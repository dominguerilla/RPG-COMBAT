COMBAT SYSTEM
=============

- Turn based
- Player is a member of a party of four (five) against any enemies they come across


COMBAT FLOW
===========
ORDER PHASE -> ATTACK PHASE -> ORDER PHASE -> ATTACK PHASE -> ...

Order Phase:
------------
	- player gives orders to each party member, deciding what they will do during the attack phase
		- do normal attack, cast skill, use item, defend, attempt escape
	- no actions are carried out until the attack phase!
	- once all party members have orders and the player has decided on their action, order phase is done

Attack Phase:
-------------
	- all combatants will perform their actions
	- turn order is based on initiative stat of each combatant
	- ** The player has the opportunity to evade/block attacks that target them **

ACTIONS
=======

ACTION TARGETING
----------------
Any action that requires a party member to target another combatant can also target a specific body part
	- body parts can include HEAD, CHEST, ARMS, LEGS
		- more/less for non-humanoid enemies?
For instance, a knight performing a standard attack with a mace has a few choices
	1. she could target the enemy's head, which deals more damage + has a chance to stun, but is less likely to hit
	2. she could target the enemy's legs, which has a chance of slowing/crippling the opponent
	3. she could target the enemy's arms, which could decrease their damage output for a few turns
	4. she could target the enemy's chest, which is the biggest target (and thus easier to hit) but is more armored

Similarly, a healer casting a standard HEAL spell has choices to make:
	1. he could target the ally's chest, which heals the most and has a chance to clear poison
	2. he could target the ally's head, which has a chance to clear stun/charmed/fear statuses
	3. he could target the ally's arms, which has a chance of removing any damage/defense debuffs
	4. he could target the ally's legs, which has a chance of removing any speed/evasion debuffs

AVAILABLE ACTIONS
-----------------
This is a list of actions that any combatant can take
	- ATTACK
		- combatant attacks with equipped weapon on the specified target and body part
	- DEFEND
