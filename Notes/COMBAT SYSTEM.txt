COMBAT SYSTEM
=============

- Turn based
- Player is directing a party of four (five?) to fight directly
- Combat takes place between enemy and adventurer party
	- adventurer party consists of NPC adventurers and the player, who is not directly involved in combat
	- each party has a front line and a back line
	- can be any number of party members in front line
		- needs to have at least one--if EVERYONE is on back line, then it's the front line
	- skills and attacks have positional requirements
		- some attacks will fail if used in the wrong position, some have DIFFERENT effects depending on where the user is position when it's cast



COMBAT FLOW
===========
ORDER PHASE -> ATTACK PHASE -> ORDER PHASE -> ATTACK PHASE -> ...

Order Phase:
------------
	- player gives orders to the party to decide what attack/move each member will do
		- do normal attack, cast skill, use item, defend, attempt escape
	- player also decides how they will support the party
		- spells / items / actions that can affect either party or enemy
	- once all party members have orders and the player has decided on their action, order phase is done

Attack Phase:
-------------
	- all combatants will perform their actions
	- turn order is based on initiative stat of each combatant
	- player's action will take place either at the start, at the end, or right after a certain combatant performs their action
		- it depends on the player's chosen action
	- if, through the actions of either party, all members of a party are in the back line by the end of the Attack Phase, that line becomes the FRONT line

ACTIONS
=======
The actions that a combatant can perform are:
	- ATTACK
		- combatant attacks with equipped weapon
	- DEFEND
		- combatant takes reduced damage + is unable to be moved (unless special skill/item says otherwise)
	- SKILL
		- combatant uses MP to perform a skill, which can deal damage, cast buffs/debuffs, move party/enemy members around
	- MOVE
		- moves to a different party line.
		- after moving, combatant gains increased resistance to forced line movement until the end of the attack phase 
		- when moving from back to front, combatant gains increased defense until the end of attack phase
		- when moving from front to back, combatant gains increased evasion until the end of attack phase
	- ITEM
		- combatant will use one of the items in their inventory
		- adventurers have limited inventory space, and can only use what items they have inside it. The player must choose the RESUPPLY action to transfer items during combat, or can replenish their inventories freely outside of it.
	- ESCAPE
		- combatant will attempt to escape from fight. If successful, all party members escape combat. 

Player Actions:
	- Analyze:
		- target: one enemy
		- records information about targeted enemy; displays health, weaknesses, resistances
	- Resupply:
		- target: one adventurer
		- gives the targeted adventurer an item, which they can use in combat
	- LOOK OUT!: 
		- target: one enemy
		- if the targeted enemy attacks during this turn, the player will warn the targeted adventurer, and that adventurer has an increased chance to dodge/block the attack.
	- Got Your Back!:
		- target: one adventurer
		- the targeted adventurer has an increased chance to dodge/block attacks that target them
	- Hold Your Ground!:
		- target: adventurer front line
