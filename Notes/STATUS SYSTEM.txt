STATUS SYSTEM
=============

Character Status
----------------
Health
Mana/Stamina (depending on class -- interchangeable)
Level


Character Stats
---------------
Note that skills can scale off of any of these stats; classes just tend to have skills that benefit from the same group of stats
Strength
	- certain physical skills + physical damage resistance
Intelligence
	- magical skills + magical damage resistance
Dexterity
	- certain physical skills + turn order + evasion
Endurance
	- maximum health + damage resistance
Luck
	- used in all calculations?

Character Anatomy
-----------------
Different races have different Anatomies. Each Anatomy consists of one or more body parts (HEAD, CHEST, ARMS, LEGS, TAIL, etc.). Each body part has different resistances/weaknesses, and they vary based on the species/breed of combatant. Attacking a specific body part of a Race could also induce additional status effects.
	- ex: the arms of 'Firefist Trolls' (totally made up race) may be very resistant to fire attacks, but susceptible to ice/water attacks, whereas the arms of 'IceBicep Ogres' (B-Ice-p Ogres?) would be the opposite.
	- ex: Slimes would only have a 'Body' and 'Core' body part; directly attacking a Slime's core would be the fastest way to defeat it.
	- ex: Earth attacks on a Beholder's main Eye could Blind it for a turn, but it will also Enrage it

DAMAGE
------
Damage has a MAGNITUDE and a TYPE. MAGNITUDE should be calculated by the weapon/skill used based on the COMBATANT's current battle stats.
The DAMAGE is passed to the target combatant along with a LIMB target, and the target(s) will calculate how much actual damage they take based on the target's current resistances/stats, as well as any special effects incurred from the DAMAGE.
TYPES:
	- BLUNT
	- SLASH
	- STAB

	- FIRE
	- WATER
	- ICE
	- WIND
	- EARTH
	- ELECTRIC
	- PSYCHIC
