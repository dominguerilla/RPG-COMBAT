Battle scenes are spawned when a battle starts. The camera should be switched over to the battle scene, which should contain all of the assets needed to start a battle.

This would include things like lighting, a stage, etc.

Additionally, you need to have two GameObjects called LeftParty and RightParty. These gameobjects should hold other gameobjects named PositionX, where X is some number and PositionX gameobjects are named sequentially. These PositionX objects are where combatants of that party stand during the fight. 

For example, LeftParty could have Position1 through Position4, and each combatant of the 'Left Party' would stand in a position.
